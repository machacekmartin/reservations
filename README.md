- `/` - Homepage for logged user (list of reservations in this case)
- `/edit-account` - For editing user information

## Built in roles
- `user` - Classic user with no special abilities
- `admin` - Has also access to /admin routes

## Before anything
After seeding db with users and roles, there are no tables or reservations. By default this user with credentials 

    admin@reservations.test
    password

is created with admin role. Log in with this account into `/admin` and add some tables. After you're done, come back to `/create-reservation` to create your reservation.

## Interactive table manipulation
There are 3 ways you can manipulate interactive tables. The styling might not be done and might require some rethinking to complete, but the tech is there ðŸ’…

- `First, in the /admin root page` - This is a generic overview of the current state. When a table is reserved for now(), it will be highlighted there with a couple options to choose from upon clicking the table
- `Second, in the /create-reservation page` - This is a selector of tables. Select a table or two, this will reflect on the available time options (Certain time options wont be available where there already is a reservation for that time)
- `Last, in the /admin/tables page` - This is a place where you can move the tables, create new ones, edit them, etc etc (with live polling btw)
