- `/` - Homepage for logged user (list of reservations in this case)
- `/edit-account` - For editing user information

## Built in roles
- `user` - Classic user with no special abilities
- `admin` - Has also access to /admin routes

## Before anything
After seeding db with users and roles, there are no tables or reservations. By default this user with credentials 

    admin@reservations.test
    password

is created with admin role. Log in with this account into `/admin` and add some tables. After you're done, come back to `/create-reservation` to create your reservation.

## Interactive table manipulation
There are 3 ways you can manipulate interactive tables. The styling might not be done and might require some rethinking to complete, but the tech is there ðŸ’…

- `First, in the /admin root page` - This is a generic overview of the current state. Meant to be used by employees. When a table is currently reserved, it will be highlighted with a couple of options to choose from upon clicking the table
- `Second, in the /create-reservation page` - This is a selector of tables meant to be used by normal users. Select a table or two, this will reflect on the available time options (certain time options wont be available where there already is a reservation for that time)
- `Last, in the /admin/tables page` - This is a place where you can move the tables and is meant to be used by admins or people who setup the restaurant layout. Create new ones, edit them, etc etc (with live polling btw)
